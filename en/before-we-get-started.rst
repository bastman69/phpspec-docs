Before we get started
=====================

Audience
--------

This book is intended for those who have an interest in applying Test-Driven Development or Behaviour-Driven Development since both have identical aims, and BDD is largely an attempt to improve the quality of practicing TDD. This book assumes you are at least familiar with the features, syntax and practice of PHP5 or any similar language especially in an object-oriented setting. No prior experience with either Unit Testing, TDD or BDD is required. We have included an introduction to the concept of Behaviour-Driven Development up front as Chapter 1.

Requirements
------------

PHPSpec was designed for PHP5, specifically any version above PHP 5.3.3. It will not work with PHP 5.2 and below.
