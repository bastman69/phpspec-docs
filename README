Contributing to documentation
=============================

Intro
-----

It is good everyone contributes with documentation.
We use sphinx and some custom styling to have offline/online documentation and automate things so that anyone can easily write rst format which is almost like markdown to write up documentation for just about anything.

``rst`` extension stands for restructured format. This short page is written in ``rst`` for your example.

Setting things up
-----------------

I follow the instructions from this `link <http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/documentation/format.html>`_.

Which basically tells us to install with the following command:

``$ sudo easy_install -U Sphinx``

How to contribute
-----------------

To clone the doc repos do:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone github.com/phpspec/phpspec-docs.git

Do your changes, commit, and push to your own fork on github, then send a PR to the main repo.

How to compile
--------------

To test or have an off line version of documentation you will just run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make html

Make sure your syntax is correct by following the error messages if any.

The idea is that everything needs to get documented properly as it is very easy to write rst on the fly.

That is it! PHPSpec FTW!
